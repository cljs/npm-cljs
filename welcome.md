# Welcome to ClojureScript

by [@shaunlebron](http://twitter.com/shaunlebron)

[ClojureScript](http://clojurescript.org) is a major contender among languages
available on the JavaScript platform. There are many resources for learning it,
but a guide cannot target its audience by describing tools not written for them.
Thus, introducing a new tool for the JavaScript audience:

```
npm install -g cljs
```

This new tool is designed to provide a first-class ClojureScript experience,
centered around the community of its platform, JavaScript, rather than the
platform of its parent language Clojure on Java.  Any reliance on the latter is
transparent to the user, and will fade away as pure JavaScript replacements
become possible.

Are you new to ClojureScript? [I'm new] | [I've dabbled] | [I'm experienced]

(customized messaging below)

## For the new

...

## For the dabbled

...

## For the experienced

This tool is not intended to provide a unified environment for both Clojure and
ClojureScript. [Lein] and [Boot] both exist to fill that purpose in different,
well-designed ways.

This tool is not intended to [fragment] the community, but rather to grow it
by having empathy for the largely untapped JavaScript audience.

This tool is not intended to double back on the years of hard work that went
into building a production-level ClojureScript compiler and experience.  On the
contrary, we are simply raising the visibility of this work by giving it a new
interface.

A good design reaches for people by meeting them where they are. From the
beginning, ClojureScript was designed to reach far by targeting the JavaScript
platform. It only makes sense to reach for its developers too.
